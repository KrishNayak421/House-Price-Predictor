The following code demonstrates how to train a linear regression model on a single predictor (`median_income`), while scaling the target values, and then making predictions that are transformed back to the original scale.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

- **Purpose:**  
  This line imports the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn, which is used to create and train a linear regression model.

---

```python
target_scaler = StandardScaler()
```

- **Purpose:**  
  Here, a `StandardScaler` object is created. The scaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- **Usage for Targets:**  
  Although scalers are often used for predictors, here it is used for scaling the target variable (labels).

---

```python
scaled_labels = target_scaler.fit_transform(data_labels.to_frame())
```

- **Steps Involved:**
  - `data_labels.to_frame()`:  
    Converts the target labels (which might be a Series) into a DataFrame. This is necessary because `StandardScaler` expects a 2D array.
  - `fit_transform(...)`:  
    First, the scaler is fitted to the target data (computing the mean and standard deviation) and then the data is transformed (scaled) accordingly.
- **Result:**  
  The target values are now scaled (standardized) so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help the model learn more effectively.

---

```python
model = LinearRegression()
```

- **Purpose:**  
  An instance of `LinearRegression` is created. This model will be trained to learn the relationship between `median_income` (the predictor) and the scaled target labels.

---

```python
model.fit(data[["median_income"]], scaled_labels)
```

- **What Happens:**
  - `data[["median_income"]]`:  
    This selects the `median_income` column from the DataFrame as the predictor. Notice the use of double brackets `[["median_income"]]` to ensure that the result is a DataFrame (not a Series).
  - `scaled_labels`:  
    These are the target values that have been standardized.
- **Purpose:**  
  The model is trained on the predictor (`median_income`) and the scaled target values. The model learns a linear relationship between these variables.

---

```python
some_new_data = data[["median_income"]].iloc[:5]
```

- **Purpose:**  
  This line selects the first 5 rows from the `median_income` column.
- **Usage:**  
  The selected data (`some_new_data`) will be used to generate predictions. It represents new (or unseen) examples.

---

```python
scaled_predictions = model.predict(some_new_data)
```

- **What Happens:**  
  The trained linear regression model is used to predict the target values for the `some_new_data`.
- **Result:**  
  The predictions are in the scaled format (i.e., standardized), because the model was trained on scaled labels.

---

```python
predictions = target_scaler.inverse_transform(scaled_predictions)
```

- **Purpose:**  
  This line converts the scaled predictions back to the original scale.
- **How:**
  - `inverse_transform(...)`:  
    Uses the parameters (mean and standard deviation) computed earlier by the scaler to revert the data back to its original units.
- **Result:**  
  `predictions` now contains the predicted target values in the same scale as the original `data_labels`.

---

## Summary

1. **Import and Create Model:**  
   Import `LinearRegression` and create a scaler for the target variable.
2. **Scale Target Values:**  
   Transform the target labels to a standardized scale.
3. **Train the Model:**  
   Fit the linear regression model using `median_income` as the predictor and the scaled target labels.
4. **Make Predictions:**  
   Use the model to predict on new data (first 5 rows of `median_income`).
5. **Revert Predictions:**  
   Transform the scaled predictions back to the original scale using the inverse transform of the scaler.

This workflow is useful when you need to handle target values that vary in scale, ensuring that the model's learning process is efficient and the predictions are interpretable in their original units.
