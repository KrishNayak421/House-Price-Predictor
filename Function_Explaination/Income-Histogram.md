# Explanation of the Code

The following code counts the number of occurrences for each category in the `income_category` column, sorts the categories by their labels, and then plots a bar chart to visualize the distribution.

```python
data["income_category"].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(rot=0, grid=True)
plt.xlabel("Income Category")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

## Detailed Breakdown

1. **Counting the Categories**

   - **Code:**
     ```python
     data["income_category"].value_counts()
     ```
   - **Explanation:**  
     This method counts how many times each unique value appears in the `"income_category"` column of the DataFrame `data`. The result is a Pandas Series where:
     - **Index:** Unique income categories (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
     - **Values:** The count of occurrences for each category.

2. **Sorting the Counts by Category**

   - **Code:**
     ```python
     .sort_index()
     ```
   - **Explanation:**  
     This sorts the resulting Series by the index (the income categories) in ascending order. Sorting ensures that when the data is plotted, the categories appear in logical order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) rather than in the order of frequency.

3. **Plotting a Bar Chart**

   - **Code:**
     ```python
     .plot.bar(rot=0, grid=True)
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - **`.plot.bar()`:**  
       This function generates a bar chart from the Series.
     - **`rot=0`:**  
       Sets the rotation of the x-axis labels to 0 degrees, ensuring that the labels are horizontal.
     - **`grid=True`:**  
       Enables a grid in the plot for better readability of the values.

4. **Labeling the Axes**

   - **Code:**
     ```python
     plt.xlabel("Income Category")
     plt.ylabel("Count")
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - **`plt.xlabel("Income Category")`:**  
       Sets the label for the x-axis to "Income Category".
     - **`plt.ylabel("Count")`:**  
       Sets the label for the y-axis to "Count", indicating that it represents the frequency of each income category.

5. **Displaying the Plot**

   - **Code:**
     ```python
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Explanation:**  
     This command renders and displays the final bar chart on the screen.

## Summary

- **Counting:** The code first counts how many data points fall into each income category.
- **Sorting:** It then sorts the counts by the income category to ensure proper order.
- **Plotting:** A bar chart is created with horizontal x-axis labels and a grid for clarity.
- **Labeling & Display:** Finally, the axes are labeled appropriately and the chart is displayed.
