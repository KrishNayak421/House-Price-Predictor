This code snippet uses scikit-learn’s `TransformedTargetRegressor` to apply a transformation to the target variable while training a regression model. In this example, we use `LinearRegression` as the base model and `StandardScaler` as the transformer for the target variable.

## Code

```python
from sklearn.compose import TransformedTargetRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create a TransformedTargetRegressor with LinearRegression as the estimator and StandardScaler as the target transformer.
model = TransformedTargetRegressor(LinearRegression(), transformer=StandardScaler())

# Fit the model using "median_income" as the predictor and data_labels as the target.
model.fit(data[["median_income"]], data_labels)

# Predict on some new data (first few rows of "median_income").
predictions = model.predict(some_new_data)

# Display the predictions.
predictions
```

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Importing Necessary Classes

- **`TransformedTargetRegressor`:**  
  This class allows you to apply a transformation to the target variable (labels) before fitting the model. After prediction, it automatically applies the inverse transformation to get predictions in the original scale.

- **`LinearRegression`:**  
  A standard linear regression model used as the underlying estimator.

- **`StandardScaler`:**  
  A transformer that standardizes data (removes the mean and scales to unit variance). Here, it’s used to standardize the target values.

---

### 2. Creating the Model

```python
model = TransformedTargetRegressor(LinearRegression(), transformer=StandardScaler())
```

- **Purpose:**
  - The `TransformedTargetRegressor` wraps around a regressor (here, `LinearRegression`) and applies the `StandardScaler` transformation to the target variable.
- **How It Works:**
  - **Before Training:**  
    The target values (data_labels) are transformed (standardized) using `StandardScaler`.
  - **During Prediction:**  
    The model makes predictions in the scaled space.
  - **After Prediction:**  
    The predictions are converted back to the original scale using the inverse of the transformation.

### 3. Fitting the Model

```python
model.fit(data[["median_income"]], data_labels)
```

- **Predictor:**
  - `data[["median_income"]]` is used as the input feature. Note the double brackets to ensure it is a DataFrame.
- **Target:**
  - `data_labels` contains the target variable (e.g., `median_house_value`).
- **Process:**
  - The model first transforms `data_labels` using `StandardScaler`.
  - It then fits a `LinearRegression` model on the predictor (`median_income`) and the transformed target.

---

### 4. Making Predictions

```python
predictions = model.predict(some_new_data)
```

- **Input:**
  - `some_new_data` is a DataFrame containing new values for `median_income`.
- **Output:**
  - The model returns predictions for the new data.
  - The predictions are automatically inverse-transformed, so they are presented in the original scale of the target variable.

---

### 5. Displaying the Predictions

```python
predictions
```

- **Purpose:**
  - This line outputs the predicted values after the inverse transformation.

## Summary

- **TransformedTargetRegressor:**  
  Allows you to apply a transformation to the target variable before model training and automatically inverse transforms predictions.
- **Model Pipeline:**
  1. **Scaling the Target:**  
     `StandardScaler` standardizes the target values.
  2. **Training:**  
     `LinearRegression` is trained on the predictor (`median_income`) and the scaled target.
  3. **Prediction:**  
     Predictions are made on new data, and then inverse-transformed to the original scale.
- **Advantage:**  
  This approach is particularly useful when the target variable has a wide range or non-normal distribution, as scaling can help improve model performance and interpretability.

This method encapsulates the transformation process, making your code cleaner and reducing the chance for errors when handling data scaling for regression tasks.
